      "question": "Which scholars won Physics in 1921?",
      "answer": "The 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Einstein \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" This was Einstein's second Nobel Prize; he had previously been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but it was actually given to him in 1922.\n\nIt's worth noting that no other scholars were awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, as the prize was not shared that year. The citation specifically highlighted Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect, which provided strong evidence for the particle nature of light and was fundamental to the development of quantum mechanics.",
