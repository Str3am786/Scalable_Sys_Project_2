      "question": "Which scholars won Physics in 1921?",
      "answer": "The 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Einstein \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" This was Einstein's second Nobel Prize; he had previously been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but the prize money was not distributed until 1922 due to financial constraints during World War I.\n\nIt's important to note that no other scholars were awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics as it was solely given to Albert Einstein for his groundbreaking work on the photoelectric effect, which provided strong evidence for the quantum theory.",
