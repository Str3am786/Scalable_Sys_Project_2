However, I can provide some information on notable scholars who died during this period, which includes the tumultuous years of World War II and the Holocaust.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n1. **Edith Stein** (1891-1942): A philosopher and Catholic nun, Stein was a professor at the University of Freiburg and the University of M\u00fcnster. She was deported to Auschwitz and killed in 1942.\n2. **Hermann Cohen** (1842-1940): A philosopher and mathematician, Cohen was a professor at the University of Marburg. He died in 1940, shortly after fleeing to France to escape Nazi persecution.\n3. **Erich Frank** (1883-1949, but died in 1945 in a concentration camp): A philosopher and classicist, Frank was a professor at the University of Heidelberg. He was imprisoned in a concentration camp and died in 1945, shortly before the camp was liberated.\n4. **Hans von Euler-Chelpin** (1873-1945): A biochemist and Nobel laureate, Euler-Chelpin was a professor at the University of Berlin. He died in 1945, shortly before the end of the war.\n5. **Otto Meyerhof** (1884-1945): A biochemist and Nobel laureate, Meyerhof was a professor at the University of Heidelberg. He died in 1945, shortly before the end of the war.\n6. **Fritz Haber** (1868-1934, but his death was related to the Nazi regime): A chemist and Nobel laureate, Haber was a professor at the University of Berlin. He died in 1934, shortly after fleeing to Switzerland to escape Nazi persecution.\n7. **Lise Meitner** (1878-1968, but forced to flee in 1938): A physicist, Meitner was a professor at the University of Berlin. She was forced to flee to Sweden in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution.\n8. **James Franck** (1882-1964, but forced to flee in 1933): A physicist and Nobel laureate, Franck was a professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.

      "model_answer": "As of my last update in 2023, there have been four female laureates in Physics awarded the Nobel Prize:\n\n1. **Marie Curie (1903 and 1911)**: Marie Curie is the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, along with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their pioneering work on radioactivity. In 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, alone, for her work on the isolation of pure radium.\n\n2. **Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963)**: Maria Goeppert Mayer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, along with Johannes Jensen, for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure. Mayer's work on the nuclear shell model provided a fundamental understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei.\n\n3. **Donna Strickland (2018)**: Donna Strickland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, along with Arthur Ashkin and G\u00e9rard Mourou, for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics. Strickland's work, conducted with Mourou, led to the development of lasers that can be used in eye surgery and other applications.\n\n4. **Andrea Ghez (2020)**: Andrea Ghez was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020, along with Reinhard Genzel, for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy. Ghez's work provided evidence for the existence of a black hole at the center of the Milky Way.\n\nThese women have made significant contributions to the field of physics, paving the way for future generations of female physicists.",
