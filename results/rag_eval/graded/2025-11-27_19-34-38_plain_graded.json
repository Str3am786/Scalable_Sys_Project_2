Smoot (USA) and John C. Mather (USA) were not awarded until 2006 for their discovery. However, in 1992, George Charpak (France) was awarded for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber.\n\n3. 1993 - Russell A. Hulse (USA) and Joseph H. Taylor Jr. (USA) - awarded for the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation.\n\n4. 1994 - Bertram N. Brockhouse (Canada) and Clifford G. Shull (USA) - awarded for pioneering contributions to the development of neutron scattering techniques for studies of condensed matter.\n\n5. 1995 - Martin L. Perl (USA) and Frederick Reines (USA) - awarded for pioneering experimental contributions to lepton physics and for the detection of the neutrino.\n\n6. 1996 - David M. Lee (USA), Douglas D. Osheroff (USA), and Robert C. Richardson (USA) - awarded for their discovery of superfluidity in helium-3.\n\n7. 1997 - Steven Chu (USA), Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (France), and William D.

Edmund Husserl (1859-1938): A philosopher and mathematician, Husserl was a professor at the University of Freiburg and is considered the founder of phenomenology. He died on April 27, 1938.\n\n2. Otto Hahn (1879-1968) did not die between these years, however his colleague  Lise Meitner (1878-1968) had to flee due to her Jewish heritage and her colleague  Fritz Strassmann (1902-1980) stayed in Germany. Their colleague  Otto Hahn's colleague  Fritz Haber (1868-1934) died a year before the specified time frame.\n\n3.  Moritz Schlick (1882-1936): An Austrian-German philosopher, Schlick was a professor at the University of Berlin and a key figure in the Vienna Circle. He was assassinated on June 22, 1936.\n\nThese are just a few examples of scholars affiliated with institutions in Germany who died between 1935 and 1945.

The 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: This prize was awarded to Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids. They each received a 1/3 share of the prize.\n\n2. The 1968 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel: This prize was awarded to Ragnar Frisch for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes, and to Jan Tinbergen for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes. However, in 1969, the first official year of the Economics prize, it was awarded to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen, with each receiving a 1/2 share of the prize. In 1968, as an informal year, Ragnar Frisch was awarded a 1/2 share, but in 1969, one of the 1968 informal Economics prize winners was awarded the 1969 formal Economics prize. However, in 1972, the Economics prize winners were Kenneth Arrow and John Hicks for their pioneering contributions to general economic equilibrium theory and welfare theory. However, in 1974, the Economics prize winners were Gunnar Myrdal and Friedrich Hayek for their pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and for their penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. However, in 1977, the Economics prize winners were Bertil Ohlin and James Meade for their pathbreaking contribution to the theory of international trade and international capital movements. However, in 1993, the Economics prize winners were Robert Fogel and Douglass North for having renewed research in economic history by applying economic theory and quantitative methods in order to explain economic and institutional change. However, in 1994, the Economics prize winners were John Nash, Reinhard Selten, and John Harsanyi for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games. John Nash received a 1/2 share, and Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi each received a 1/4 share. However, in 1997, the Economics prize winners were Robert Merton and Myron Scholes for a new method to determine the value of derivatives. However, in 1998, the Economics prize winner was Amartya Sen",
