      "model_answer": "As of my last update in October 2023, several Nobel laureates in Physics were born in Paris. However, the exact number can change as new laureates are announced. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. **Louis de Broglie** (1892-1987) - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.\n2. **Claude Cohen-Tannoudji** (1933-present) - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for the development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light.\n\nThese are just a couple of examples, and there may be others. For the most current and comprehensive list, you would need to refer to the official Nobel Prize website or other reliable sources.",

      "question": "How many scholars won a prize with a 1/3 share portion?",
      "model_answer": "To determine how many scholars won a prize with a 1/3 share portion, we need more specific information about the context in which this question is being asked. Typically, such questions arise in the context of academic awards, Nobel Prizes, or other prestigious recognitions where prizes are shared among multiple recipients.\n\nFor example, in the case of the Nobel Prizes, the prize money is often divided among the laureates. If a prize is shared equally among three recipients, each would receive a 1/3 share. However, without specific details about the number of prizes, the number of scholars, or the distribution of shares, it's impossible to provide an exact answer.\n\nIf you can provide more context or details, such as the specific award or the number of scholars involved, I can give a more precise answer.",
