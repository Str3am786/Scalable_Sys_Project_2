      "model_answer": "The Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1921 was awarded to Albert Einstein. \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" There was no other recipient that year. The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when light is shone on it. Einstein's explanation of this effect, using the concept of photons, was a significant contribution to the development of quantum theory.",

Here are some notable scholars who died during this period:\n\n1. **Ernst Cassirer** (1874-1945): A philosopher and scholar of the history of philosophy, Cassirer was forced to flee Germany in 1933 due to his Jewish heritage. He died in New York City in 1945.\n\n2. **Theodor Adorno** (1903-1969): Although he did not die during this period, it's worth mentioning that Adorno, a prominent sociologist and philosopher, was forced into exile in 1934. He returned to Germany after the war and died in 1969.\n\n3. **Max Horkheimer** (1895-1973): Another prominent sociologist and philosopher, Horkheimer was also forced into exile in 1933.

He died in Portbou, Spain, in 1940 while attempting to flee the Nazis.\n\n5. **Hannah Arendt** (1906-1975): Although she did not die during this period, Arendt was forced to flee Germany in 1933. She later settled in the United States and died in 1975.\n\n6. **Erich Auerbach** (1892-1957): A literary scholar, Auerbach was forced to leave Germany in 1936 due to his Jewish heritage. He died in 1957 in the United States.\n\n7. **Leo Strauss** (1899-1973): A political philosopher, Strauss was forced to leave Germany in 1932. He died in the United States in 1973.\n\n8. **Hans-Georg Gadamer** (1900-2002): Although he did not die during this period, Gadamer, a philosopher, was dismissed from his position at the University of Leipzig in 1939 due to his opposition",
