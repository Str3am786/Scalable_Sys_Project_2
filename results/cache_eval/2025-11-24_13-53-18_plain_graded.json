      "question": "Which scholars won Physics in 1921?",
      "model_answer": "The 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Einstein \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" This was Einstein's second Nobel Prize; he had previously been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but the prize money was not distributed until 1922 due to World War I.\n\nIt's worth noting that no other scholars were awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, as it was solely given to Albert Einstein for his groundbreaking work on the photoelectric effect, which provided strong evidence for the particle nature of light and laid the foundation for quantum mechanics.",

      "model_answer": "Paris has been a significant center of learning and culture for centuries, attracting many scholars from around the world. Here are a few notable scholars who were either born or spent a significant part of their lives in Paris:\n\n1. **Marie Curie** - Born in Warsaw, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire), she moved to Paris in 1891 to study physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne. She conducted her groundbreaking research on radioactivity there.\n\n2. **Simone de Beauvoir** - Born in Paris in 1908, she was a leading figure in existentialism and feminist philosophy. She is best known for her book \"The Second Sex,\" which is considered a foundational text in feminist theory.\n\n3. **Jean-Paul Sartre** - Born in Paris in 1905, he was a key figure in 20th-century philosophy, particularly in existentialism and phenomenology. He taught at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.\n\n4. **\u00c9mile Zola** - Born in Paris in 1840, he was a major French novelist, journalist, and playwright. He is famous for his series of novels collectively known as Les Rougon-Macquart, which detail the lives of a family across several generations.\n\n5. **Henri Poincar\u00e9** - Although he was born in Nancy, France, Poincar\u00e9 spent much of his career in Paris, where he worked at the Sorbonne and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He made significant contributions to mathematics, theoretical physics, and philosophy of science.\n\n6. **Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss** - Born in Brussels but raised in Paris, L\u00e9vi-Strauss was a renowned anthropologist who developed structural anthropology. He taught at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris.\n\nThese individuals represent just a small fraction of the many scholars who have called Paris home.

      "model_answer": "To provide you with a list of scholars affiliated with institutions in Germany who died between 1935 and 1945, I would need to conduct a detailed search through historical records and academic databases. This task is quite extensive and requires access to specific archives and databases that may not be publicly available.\n\nHowever, I can give you some context and mention a few notable cases:\n\n1. **Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906)**: Although he died before the specified period, Boltzmann's suicide in 1906 is often discussed in the context of the early 20th century pressures on academics. His struggles with the reception of his theories and personal issues have been linked to the broader cultural and political climate of the time.\n\n2. **Otto Hahn (1879-1968)**: Otto Hahn was a chemist who made significant contributions to nuclear physics. While he did not die during the period in question, he faced challenges during World War II and the Nazi regime. He continued his work but had to navigate the difficult political landscape.\n\n3. **Max Planck (1858-1947)**: Max Planck, a physicist known for his work on quantum theory, lived through much of the Nazi era. He was a prominent figure in German science and had to deal with the political pressures of the time. While he did not die during the specified period, his life and career were significantly impacted by the events of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n4. **Bruno Walter (1876-1962)**: Bruno Walter was a conductor and composer who fled Germany in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. He died in 1962, which means he did not die within the specified period, but his experiences fleeing Germany highlight the impact of the Nazi regime on intellectuals.\n\n5. **Hans Bethe (1906-2005)**: Hans Bethe, while not dying during the specified period, was a theoretical physicist who worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin before emigrating to the United States. His work on the Manhattan Project and his later contributions to physics were influenced by the political situation in Germany.\n\nFor a comprehensive list, you would need to consult historical records from universities and research institutions in Germany from that era, as well as biographical databases and historical",

      "model_answer": "To the best of my knowledge, there have been several scholars affiliated with institutions in France who have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (commonly referred to as the Economics prize). Here are a few notable examples:\n\n1. **Jean Tirole** - He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2014 for his analysis of market power and regulation. Tirole is a professor at Toulouse School of Economics and the Toulouse School of Management.\n\n2. **Alvin E. Roth** and **Alvin E. Roth** (along with Lloyd S. Shapley) - Alvin E. Roth shared the prize in 2012 with Lloyd S. Shapley for the study of stable allocations and the design of market mechanisms. While Roth is not French, Shapley's work was influential in this area, and Roth has strong ties to institutions in the United States and Europe, including Harvard University and Stanford University.\n\n3. **Eliana La Ferrara** - She was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2021 for her research on the causes and consequences of civil conflict. La Ferrara is a professor at Sciences Po Paris.\n\n4. **Jean-Jacques Laffont** - He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2007 for his analysis of incentives in markets and organizations. Laffont was a professor at the University of Paris Dauphine.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there may be other scholars from French institutions who have won the prize.
