      "question": "Which scholars won Physics in 1921?",
      "answer": "The 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Einstein \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" This was Einstein's second Nobel Prize; he had previously been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, but it was actually given to him in 1922.\n\nIt's worth noting that no other scholars were awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, as the prize was not awarded that year. The Nobel Foundation decided not to award any prizes in 1921 due to a lack of suitable candidates or nominations. The prize was instead awarded to Einstein in 1922 for his 1921 work on the photoelectric effect.",
